<h1>Payment authorized</h1>
<p>
Your payment has been initially authorized.
</p>

<p>
This means that your payment is likely to complete. However, the processing
of your payment happens asynchronously, and it might depend on your card
issuer. Our systems will automatically process the payment as it completes
from your provider, and update the status of your invoice. Once your
payment is fully authorized, a receipt will be generated for you
automatically.
</p>

<p>
This authorization will typically only take a few seconds, but in case of
technical issues or high load with our payment provider it may take a little
bit longer. This page will automatically refresh and direct you to your
receipt once the payment is completed. You can also always manually
<a href="{{url}}">Return</a> to the status of your order.
