<h1>Payment pending</h1>
<p>
Your payment is currently pending.

<p>
Your payment is currently held in pending state at our payment processor.
It will likely complete at a later time, and you will then automatically

your invoice.

If your invoice does not complete in a few days, please contact
treasurer@postgresopen.org citing the full details of your payment for manual
