<h1>Payment error</h1>

An invalid cryptographical signature was returned from our payment processor.

This is most likely due to your webbrowser limiting or otherwise modifying
the return URL. Your payment may still have been processed asynchronously.
Please go to your <a href="/invoices/">list of invoices</a> and check it's
status in 5-10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
If your invoice has not been processed by then, please contact
treasurer@postgresopen.org citing the full details of your payment for manual
verification and processing.
